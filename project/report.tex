\begin{abstract}
Face recognition is an exciting and emerging field of computer vision with many  applications to hardware and devices. Using embedded platforms like the Raspberry Pi, a camera module and open source computer vision libraries like OpenCV, purpose is to add face recognition to Robot car and also facial recognition using free developer version of Kairos Facial Recognition software.
In today`s modern world, face recognition playing an important role for the purpose of security and surveillance and hence there is a need for an efficient and cost effective system. So the main goal is to explore the feasibility of implementing Raspberry Pi based facial recognition system using conventional face detection and recognition techniques such as Haarcascade detection and Kairos. An obstacle avoidance Robot car is integrated with Raspberry Pi and a camera module aiming at taking face recognition to a level in which the system can identify the humans who are stuck in buildings during earth quakes.  Raspberry Pi kit provides the system cost effective and easy to use, with high performance.

\section{Introduction}
A Computer Vision application which has always encouraged people, concern about the capability and capacity of  robots and computers to determine, detect, recognize and interact with human beings ~\cite{Boris2014}. We will prevail the advantage of cheaper tools that are available in market for computing and detecting human face from the image, recognizing the face using hardware like Raspberry Pi and a video camera that is dedicated to Raspberry Pi. Simple and open source software like OpenCV is used to detect human face from the video that is being captured and the image will be sent to Kairos facial recognition software which allows a high level approach to this process.

In this fastest information era, every information is travelled in split of seconds. There is much more need for accurate and fastest methods in identifying, recognizing and authentication of humans. In the present world, Facial recognition had became most important and crucial form of human identification methods. As per Literature survey statistics in face recognition, the two trends to receive significant attention for the past several years are; the first is the law enforcement applications and also wide range of commercial techniques, and the second is exponential booming of applications and feasible technologies after 30 years of research ~\cite{Riddhi2013}.

The aim is achieved by a possibility to locate human beings or their parts like faces from the live video capture and within the pictures context. Most advanced human detection applications have this functionality already available. When the picture is capture and loaded into the system, it will scan the picture and will look for human faces in it. Current implementation is to detect face and register them with a name. If the face is detected and not recognized, Robot car will ask to register the detected face with a name. If the human is already registered in Kairos, then once the face is detected, Robot car will greet the human with the associated name.This whole process determines the Face detection and Face recognition techniques using Raspberry Pi and Robot car.

Facial biometric data is to be computed first in creating a complete recognition system. This biometric data is then compared with the face database and to associate with the human identity. The difference between a human and machine is, a human can easily and quickly identify characteristics of a human face but then can only save few hundreds of faces. Whereas a machine or computers prevails at storing and mapping human characteristics and meta data. In current generation, facial recognition softwares can identify a human face with in millions of images from the database in seconds. Humans tend to forget human faces as time pass by. Machines stores them forever. Most of the Law firms across the world follow the process and spend huge money with development of these facial recognition systems that can easily identify criminals in real-time. A well-known example is studying human faces in airports and bus stations.

The design of the Robot car integrated with Face recognition system will navigate through dangerous or natural disaster locations where humans unable to enter. Robot car while avoiding obstacles on its way, will continuously monitor for human faces who got stuck or in danger and will recognize the faces based on the user database. Once the human face is recognized, it will intimate to corresponding authorities about the human and will help in guiding assistance. 

\section{Face Detection}
Face Detection is a technique referred to computer vision technology which is able to identify human faces within digital images ~\cite{Divya2013}. Face detection applications works using algorithms and machine learning formulas for detecting human faces in the visual images. Identifying only human faces from these images which can contains landscapes, houses, animals is called Face Detection technique.

Face Detection is termed to only identify if there are any humans present in the image or a video. It lacks in ability to recognize which human face is present. Common widely used face detection techniques are in auto-focus of a digital camera. During auto-focus, camera lens will look for human faces in the range and identify them to have focus in that particular area.
Face Detection techniques will be widely used in counting how many number of visitors attending a particular event.

\subsection{How Face Detection Works}
While Face Detection process is somewhat complex, the algorithms will start off by searching for human eyes at first. Eyes usually represents a valley region and its the easiest feature in human face to detect. Once the eyes are detected, then the algorithms will look for rest of the characteristics of a human face such as iris, nose, mouth, eyebrows and nostrils. Face detection algorithm then summarizes the data and shows that it has successfully detected a human face from the facial region. An additional tests can be conducted by the algorithm to make sure and validate if its detected human face or not ~\cite{Jesse2017}.

\section{Face Recognition}
Like all biometrics solutions, face recognition technology measures and matches the unique characteristics for the purposes of identification or authentication. Often leveraging a digital or connected camera, facial recognition software can detect faces in images, quantify their features, and then match them against stored templates in a database.
Face scanning biometric tech is incredibly versatile and this is reflected in its wide range of potential applications.
Face biometrics have the potential to be integrated anywhere you can find a modern camera. Law enforcement agencies the world over use biometric software to scan faces in CCTV footage, as well as to identify persons of interest in the field. Border control deployments use face recognition to verify the identities of travelers. It even has consumer applications.
One of the most important applications of face detection, however, is facial recognition. Face recognition describes a biometric technology that goes way beyond recognizing when a human face is present. It actually attempts to establish whose face it is. The process works using a computer application that captures a digital image of an individual’s face (sometimes taken from a video frame) and compares it to images in a database of stored records. While facial recognition isn`t 100\% accurate, it can very accurately determine when there is a strong chance that an person’s face matches someone in the database.
In the model employed for the extraction of the features from the images, the reference matrices have different shapes, such as the ones that can be seen in figure, that are more suitable for determining the shapes belonging to the human body, like the eyes or the nose. From this comes their denomination of Haar Features, to distinguish them from their original meaning. The same picture shows the shape of the features used by OpenCV and SimpleCV. The presence or not of a Haar feature in a portion of the picture happens by subtracting the median pixel value that are present in the black  mask  portion, from the median value of the pixels that are present in the clear part of the mask. If the difference is above a certain threshold value, the feature is considered as present. The threshold value is determined, for each feature, during the function training, to detect particular objects or parts of the human body. The learning process materializes itself when presenting to the Vision System the highest possible number of images concerning the objects family that we want to identify, and the highest possible number of images that have nothing to share with the object itself. From the amount of data that are studied, the threshold values are calculated, for each of the features that, in the case of OpenCV and SimpleCV, are memorized as a file in .xml format.

For the past few years, Face recognition has became on of the most commonly used bio-metric authentication techniques. It maily deals with the Pattern recognition and analyzing the images. Two main tasks of Facial recognition are: Face verification and Face Identification. Face Verification is comparing a human face in an image with a template image and recognizing the correct patterns. Face Identification is comparing human face in an image with multiple images in the database. Face recognition techniques have more advantages than any other biometrics. With well sophesticated algorithms and coading, Face recognition has a high recognition rate or high identification rate of more than 90\% ~\cite{Riddhi2013}.

\section{Software and Hardware Specifications}
OpenCV is to be installed in Raspberry Pi to detect human faces with in the captured images. Kairos Facial recognition software is used to recognize human face and identify with the corresponding name.

\subsection{Software Used}

\subsubsection{Raspian OS}
This is the recommended OS for Raspberry Pi 3.  Raspbian OS is debian based OS. It can be installed from noobs installer. Raspbian comes with pre-installed softwares such as Python, Sonic Pi, Java, Mathematica for programming and education.
\subsubsection{Putty}
PuTTY is an SSH and telnet client, developed originally by Simon Tatham for the Windows platform. PuTTY is open source software that is available with source code and is developed and supported by a group of volunteers. Here we are using putty for accessing our raspberry pi remotely.

\subsubsection{OpenCV}
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code. The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects and extract 3D models of objects ~\cite{opencv}.

\subsubsection{Python 2 IDE}
Python 2.7.x version Integrated Development Environment is used to compile python program in Raspberry Pi. IDE is a text editor plus terminal combination which is used to work on large projects with complex code bases.

\subsubsection{Kairos Facial Recognition Software}
Kairos is an artificial intelligence company specializing in face recognition. Through computer vision and machine learning, Kairos can recognize faces in videos, photos, and the real-world. A captured image is sent to Kairos using an API call and then Kairos will search with the face database. If it matches then will reply with the human name.

\end{description}

\subsection{Kairos Face Recognition Setup}
Kairos Face Recognition system has a free developer account which is used to identify the human name from the images. Once registered a human name with an image, the code will call Kairos API with a newly detected human face and will look for the registered name. Kairos will do a quick lookup in human database from the registered account and if it matches, will send the name of the human back to the code.

Setup as follows:

\begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] Register will https:/www.kairos.com as a free developer account
    \item[$\bullet$] Login with regisetered username and password
    \item[$\bullet$] Create an Appname
    \item[$\bullet$] An App ID and a key are generated. Save this for future use
    \item[$\bullet$] Enroll users and a gallery name with the user images
    \begin{lstlisting}
    POST /enroll HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    app_id: 4985f625
    app_key: aa9e5d2ec3b00306b2d9588c3a25d68e
    {
    "image":" http://media.kairos.com/user.jpg ",
    "subject_id":"User",
    "gallery_name":"MyGallery"
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{description}

\section{Code Explanation}
\subsection{Face Detection}
Import all the related libraries including PiCamera and PiRGBArray libraries for camera to operate in Raspberry Pi. These libraries will help to capture video and images from the PiCamera.

\begin{lstlisting}
from picamera.array import PiRGBArray
from picamera import PiCamera
import time
import cv2
import sys
import imutils
from fractions import Fraction
import base64
import requests
import json
import random
import os
\end{lstlisting}

Haarcascade is a tool to capture the frontal features of face. This tool will help to continuous monitoring for any human face to detect. Once detected a human face, the output values will provide as Human Face Detected from the capturing video.

\begin{lstlisting}
# Get user supplied values
cascPath = './haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml'

# Create the haar cascade
faceCascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cascPath)
\end{lstlisting}

Camera settings needs to be updated in the code as per below suggestions. The capture image is to be sent to Kairos for Facial recognition and so we will set the resolution to a lower level. This will help to send the image faster over the network without any delay.

\begin{lstlisting}
# initialize the camera and grab a reference to the raw camera capture
camera = PiCamera()
camera.resolution = (160, 120)
camera.framerate = 32
rawCapture = PiRGBArray(camera, size=(160, 120))
\end{lstlisting}

Below code represents PiCamera continously monitor for human faces detected from the grayscale video capture. Once the human face is detected, espeak function in Raspberry Pi will send the voice to a connected speaker and will output as ``Human face detected``. This detected image is then saved as ``User-Image.jpg`` which is then will be sent to Kairos during Face recognition.

Here are the front, sideviews of the face detected images.

    lastTime = time.time()*1000.0

    # Draw a rectangle around the faces
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        cv2.circle(image, (x+w/2, y+h/2), int((w+h)/3), (255, 255, 255), 1)
    # show the frame
    cv2.imshow("Frame", image)
    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if len(faces) == 1:
        print("Taking image...")
	camera.capture("foo.jpg")
	os.system('espeak "Human face detected"')
	inputImage= "./foo.jpg"
	del camera
	break 
	# clear the stream in preparation for the next frame
    rawCapture.truncate(0)
    
	# if the `q` key was pressed, break from the loop

\section{Application}
There are lots of applications of face recognition. Face recognition is already being used to unlock phones and specific applications. Face recognition is also used for biometric surveillance. Banks, retail stores, stadiums, airports and other facilities use facial recognition to reduce crime and prevent violence.
